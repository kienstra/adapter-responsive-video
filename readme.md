## Description ##

* Requires [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 3.2 or later
* Video automatically resizes
* Won't overflow its area, even on a mobile screen
* With the [Video widget](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/) in WordPress 4.8 and later, this widget is less necessary for videos
* Though this widget still works with videos, the [Video widget](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/) displays well in many [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) themes
* But this widget is now more useful for embeds like [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net), [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
