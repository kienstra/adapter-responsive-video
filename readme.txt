A widget for videos and embeds from [YouTube](https://youtube.com), [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), and more. Resizes to its container.

== Description ==

* Requires [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 3.2 or later
* This responsive widget resizes with its container
* With the [Video widget](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/) in WordPress 4.8 and later, this widget is less necessary for videos
* Though this widget still works with videos, the [Video widget](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/) displays well in many [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) themes
* But this widget also supports embeds like [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net), [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
